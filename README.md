# SupplyChainGuardian

SupplyChainGuardian is a security framework designed to monitor and secure software supply chains. It analyzes project dependencies, checks for vulnerabilities, malicious code, and verifies package integrity. The tool helps ensure that software projects are built from trusted sources, and it provides alerts when potential security issues are detected.

## Features
- **Dependency Scanning**: Supports Node.js, Python, and Maven project dependencies.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Checks dependencies for known security vulnerabilities.
- **Malicious Code Detection**: Alerts when a dependency is flagged for malicious code.
- **Signature Verification**: Ensures that package signatures are valid and match expected sources.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Provides security alerts with severity levels and remediation steps.
- **Supply Chain Monitoring**: Continuously monitors dependencies and alerts on security issues.

## Installation

To get started with SupplyChainGuardian, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SupplyChainGuardian.git
cd SupplyChainGuardian
go mod tidy
Usage
Run the application to scan a project for security issues:

bash
Copiar código
go run main.go
SupplyChainGuardian will:

Scan the project directory for dependencies (Node.js, Python, Maven).

Check each dependency for vulnerabilities, malicious code, and signature verification.

Output an SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and a list of security alerts.

Example Output:
pgsql
Copiar código
Generated SBOM with 5 dependencies
Found 3 security alerts
